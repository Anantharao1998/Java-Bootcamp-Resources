/* FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
    
Question: the constants are final, so why can't we make them public? It's not possible for the caller to update them.
  Answer: Even if the constant is final, I prefer to expose a method instead of the variable. But if you want to expose the variable, that's also correct.

Question: isn't it better to use an enum instead of a list of constants?
  Answer: Yes! But Enums haven't been covered yet. They are covered in the section: Inheritance and Polymorphism. */
